excerpt: 'Extreme value analysis for time series is often based on the block maxima method, in particular for environmental applications. In the classical univariate case, the latter is based on fitting an extreme-value distribution to the sample of (annual) block maxima. Mathematically, the target parameters of the extreme-value distribution also show up in limit results for other high order statistics, which suggests estimation based on blockwise large order statistics. It is shown that a naive approach based on maximizing an inde- pendence log-likelihood yields an estimator that is inconsistent in general. A consistent, bias-corrected estimator is proposed, and is analyzed theoretically and in finite-sample simulation studies. The new estimator is shown to be more efficient than traditional counterparts, for instance for estimating large return levels or return periods'
