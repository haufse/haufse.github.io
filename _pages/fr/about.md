Welcome to my website! I am a doctoral student at the [Chair of Mathematical Statistics](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/), Ruhr University Bochum. Together with my doctoral advisor [Prof. Dr. Axel BÃ¼cher](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-buecher/staff/axel-buecher/) we form the task force working on [ClimXtreme](https://www.climxtreme.de/), which is a BMBF-funded project.
